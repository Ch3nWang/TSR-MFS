Demo codes of the work "Tensorized Synergistic Representation for Multi-View Unsupervised Feature Selection" 

Some tips to use this package code:
Open main.m to run TSR-MFS. 
The default experiment uses the Yale dataset, which is included in the package.
You can replace the dataset in the experiment as you want.
We run the demo on MATLAB R2024a on a personal computer with the AMD Ryzen 5 7500F 6-Core Processor and 32 GB RAM.
